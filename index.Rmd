## Introduction

Hi, I am Shun Xie and you can call me Leo if it is more convenient for you. I am currently a first year Biostatistics student under public health data science track at Columbia University. But before I come to the US, I spent 8 years studying in the UK. I enjoy the time in both places and I also enjoy traveling all around world. For academic part, I am willing to learn new thesis and applying it. During my graduate study at Imperial, I was focused on applying distance correlation into an economic project, which no other economic paper has considered the new technique. I believe that the new methods can capture more non-linear correlation and therefore, it will be very helpful in data analysis.
