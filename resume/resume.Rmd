Professional Experience {data-icon=suitcase}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Data Analyst Intern

Yum China

Shanghai, China

May 2023 - Aug 2023

-	Identified anomalies in the data due to holidays by applying CNN on time series data
-	Reconstructed weekly report after communication with operation team using HiveSQL; Improve SOP ability by supporting operation team to maintain weekly report dashboard
-	Based on A/Btest for the new ai recommendation strategy on cltv1 (low-frequency user), discovered an improvement in ARPU but a decrease in transaction frequency; Proposed to solve the problem by splitting cltv1 into new and sleeping member groups
-	Improved customer value by constructing user churn model using LightGBM/MLP (AUC: 0.86) and defined the KPI via customer return rate for churn model evaluation
-	Offered a data-driven solution using Shapley Value and WOE during weekly meeting; Presented the solution with Altair/Seaborn visualization package to the operation team
-	Summarize the key attributes of churn users through K-means clustering on PySpark



### Data Analyst, Intern

Research Experience {data-icon=laptop}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Study of Life Expectancy

Group Leader, Columbia University

New York

Nov 2022 - Dec 2022


- Built main page of website using R and html language, published the website on github webpage
- Impute dataset using k mean imputation with 4 groups regarding to countries income level and verified using k mean clustering 
- Based on Pearson and distance correlation, confirmed that linear regression is sufficient for life expectancy analysis and achieved an adjusted R square of 0.78.
- Chose as the paradigm of the projects and displayed in lecture’s webpage


### Correlation between Unemployment and Wages

Master Thesis, Imperial College London

London, UK

Oct 2021 - Jun 2022

- Applied Distance Correlation in a new field and captured additional 10% non-linear correlations.
- Implemented spatial regression with approximate profile-likelihood estimator (APLE) to solve the problem of nonzero spatial correlation.
- Iterated over confounders and concluded that the correlation arises from confounders under different time lag

### Depression Status Predicted by COVID-19 Associated Behavior Change

Group Leader, Yale University

Remote

Jun 2021 - Sep 2021

- Increased accuracy by an average of 6% after replacing selected models (Logistic Regression, Mixed Logistic
Regression, Random Forest, k-NN) by Linear SVM
- Improved sensitivity by 0.6 in k-NN and LR using Under-sampling, Lower-sampling to tackle unbalanced data.
- Identified Random Forest achieved the optimal F-score (0.787) and sensitivity (0.750) using 4-fold cross-validation

### Evaluation of Supervised Classification Models for Image Recognition

Academic, Imperial College London

London, UK
